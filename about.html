    <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>I was born and raised in Meru where i also attended school and later enrolled into The University of Nairobi for a Bachelor of Degree in Education. However, that was not my course of choice but my parent's. During my long holiday,same year,i joined Kenyatta University's Digital School to study Information Technology. I've been juggling two courses since then.</p>
      <p>I love programming because it allows me to invent a lot of things with the least of resources. All i need is a well functioning computer. Amazing,right? </p>
    <p>My hobbies include;</p>

        <li>reading novels</li>
